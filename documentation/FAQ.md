### Q: I updated my pack to 1.13, but almost none of the OptiFine features work anymore. What happened?
A: Starting from 1.13 onwards, the old `mcpatcher` folder has been merged with the `optifine` folder. All of OptiFine's resource pack features are now contained in this folder, keeping things nice and organized.
